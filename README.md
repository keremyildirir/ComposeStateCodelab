# Basic State Codelab – Jetpack Compose

This project is based on the [Android Compose Basic State Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-state) and updated with UI improvements.  
The goal is to learn **state management** and **state hoisting** in Jetpack Compose.

## What I Learned
- **State in Compose** – Understanding how state works and drives UI changes in Jetpack Compose
- **Events in Compose** – Handling user interactions by passing event callbacks between composables
- **Memory in a Composable Function** – Using `remember` to retain state during recomposition
- **Restore State in Compose** – Using `rememberSaveable` to preserve state across configuration changes
- **State Hoisting** – Moving state to a common parent composable to follow unidirectional data flow
- **Working with Lists** – Managing list state and updates efficiently in Compose
- **Observable MutableList** – Using observable lists that notify Compose when data changes
- **State in ViewModel** – Storing and managing UI state in a lifecycle-aware way
